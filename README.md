# Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch Labs (IBM Course)

This repository contains lab exercises and projects for building and experimenting with deep neural networks using PyTorch. These labs are organized into weekly folders, from Week 1 to Week 6, and are based on IBM's Deep Learning with PyTorch course. Each lab is hosted on Skills Network, providing hands-on experience with various neural network architectures and training techniques. Hope this helps you the same way it helped me.

## What's in this repo

The labs in this repo cover essential concepts and techniques for working with deep neural networks using PyTorch. Through these exercises, you will learn:

- Basic PyTorch operations and tensor manipulations
- Implementing feedforward neural networks
- Working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Training and evaluating models on datasets
- Fine-tuning and optimizing models for performance

## Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher)
- **PyTorch** (version 1.8 or higher)
- Basic knowledge of machine learning and neural networks

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dynah63/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch-IBM.git
   cd deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch-IBM
   ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
```
3. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Lab Structure

This repository is organized by week, with each week covering a different aspect of deep learning with PyTorch:

- **Week 1** : Introduction to PyTorch Tensors and Datasets
- **Week 2** : Linear Regression
- **Week 3** : Linear Regression Pytorch way
- **Week 4** : Multiple Input Output Linear Regression
- **Week 5** : Logistic Regression, Softmax Regression
- **Week 6**: Shallow Neural networks, Deep Networks and Convolutional Neural Network

Each week's folder contains Jupyter notebooks with exercises and examples.

## How to use this repo

Each lab is in a separate folder with detailed instructions. To run a lab:

1. Navigate to the weekâ€™s directory, e.g.,

```bash
cd week1

```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook for the lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the exercises.
